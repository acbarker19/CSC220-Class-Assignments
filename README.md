# CSC220 Class Assignments
A repository of multiple small projects from my second programming class, Programming and Problem Solving II at the University of Mount Union.

Some code is supplied by Dr. James Klayder and modified by Alec Barker. Some helper files are used that were created for Princeton University's CS department.

It contains projects that do the following:
- Use arrays
- Use arraylists
- Draw arcs
- Use a menu on a frame
- Track mouse movement and mouse events
- Switch between multiple frames
- Use a multi-dimensional array
- Parse a String into a Double and display the number with two decimal points
- Read and write to a file
- Draw shapes using recursion
- Take a user input String and manipulate it
